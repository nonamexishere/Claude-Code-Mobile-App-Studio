# Claude Code Mobile Studio

An AI-powered virtual mobile app development studio that runs entirely inside **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)**. Build iOS, Android, and cross-platform mobile apps with a team of specialized AI agents and workflow skills.

Inspired by [Claude Code Game Studios](https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios).

## What Is This?

Claude Code Mobile Studio is a **configuration layer** for Claude Code — a collection of agent definitions, skill workflows, hooks, and settings that transform Claude Code into a full mobile development studio. It's not a library or framework; it's a team of AI specialists that live in your terminal.

```

## Guided Workflow (Orchestration Layer)

The studio is designed to feel like a guided game — you're never left staring at a blank prompt wondering what to run next.

- **Handoff menus** — every skill ends with a numbered "what's next?" block so you can pick the next step by number or stay and chat.
- **MVP anchor** — `/start` and `/brainstorm` write a one-line MVP to `.claude/session/mvp.md`. It shows up in every skill's Status block so the north star is always visible.
- **Session breadcrumbs** — each skill appends a timestamped line to `.claude/session/active.md`, giving you a running log of what's been done.
- **SessionStart hook** — every time you open Claude Code in this directory, the hook surfaces your MVP, review mode, and the last 40 lines of breadcrumbs so context is never lost.
- **Review gates** — pick a mode during `/start`:
  - `solo` — no gates, move fast
  - `lean` — directors review at phase boundaries (architecture, build, publish)
  - `full` — directors review after every meaningful skill

At phase-boundary skills, the designated director (mobile-architect, tech-lead, or product-owner) is auto-spawned to review before the handoff. See `.claude/docs/review-gates.md` for the full trigger matrix.

## Examples

### Start a new React Native app
```
/start my-fitness-app
> Select: React Native (Expo)
> Select: Firebase
> Select: Zustand
```

### Ask for architecture advice
```
@mobile-architect I'm building a social media app with offline support.
Should I use React Native or Flutter? We need real-time messaging and
image uploads.
```

### Build a complete feature
```
/team-feature user-profile
```
This orchestrates multiple agents to design, build, test, and review the feature.
